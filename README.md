My life consists of diverse interests and passions, extending well beyond the confines of work and academia. I cherish moments spent with family and friends, find solace in the pages of a good book, and explore the world of thrift shopping. My dedication to fitness is matched by a deep-seated love for creating art—be it through painting, drawing, or sculpting with clay. This love for art ignited my decision to major in Interactive Media Arts (IMA), a field I perceive as a blend of artistic creativity and financial pragmatism. It represents a middle ground where my artistic inclinations can coexist with the practicalities of earning a stable income, a balance between passion and economic necessity.

In my life, passion and financial considerations are two pillars that strongly influence my vision for the future. With its relentless demands, navigating the modern work culture poses a significant challenge for someone like me who treasures solitude and often grapples with imposter syndrome—the persistent feeling of self-doubt and inadequacy in professional settings. To counter this, I've taken a bold step by limiting access to my resume to specific hours: between 2 AM and 3 AM on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. This unconventional approach is more than a mere whimsical choice; it's a deliberate act of defiance against the norms of the job market and a reclaiming of my personal space and time. It echoes the growing call to resist overwork and to acknowledge the value of personal time in our society.

By setting these specific hours for resume access, I aim to underscore the notion that our lives should not be wholly consumed by work. This decision challenges the traditional 9-to-5 work culture, emphasizing that my worth, both as an individual and a professional, is not tied to perpetual availability. It subtly shifts the power dynamics in job searching, underscoring the idea that employment is a reciprocal relationship where mutual respect and value for one’s time and well-being are paramount.

The choice of 2 AM to 3 AM as the viewing window for my resume is symbolic, representing the often arbitrary and demanding hurdles we face in our fast-paced, capitalist society. It's a metaphorical statement about setting boundaries and prioritizing personal values over societal expectations. This stance is a reflection of my belief in a balanced life, where professional ambitions do not overshadow the need for personal growth, artistic expression, and meaningful connections.
